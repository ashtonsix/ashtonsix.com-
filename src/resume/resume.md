## Engineering Leader

Years of creating products at small tech startups, has given me the privilege of
working intimately with brilliant founders and colleagues from a wide range of
backgrounds. I do everything from interaction design to scalable infrastructure.
I'm obsessed by context; I love speaking with customers and aligning product
roadmaps with their needs. I believe people come first.

</div>

Bootstrapped, designed, built, and onboarded 2,000 users to my compute platform
for AI professionals and students. As _**first-to-market**_ with persistent
storage for spot servers, I _**reduced costs by 60%**_ compared to the previous
industry standard. As I transitioned from minimum viable product to maturity,
Google, Paperspace, and Crestle started making similar improvements to their own
offerings.

Salamander is the only ML-ready cloud to include advanced features like complete
usage audits, and to offer free credits to students via the GitHub education
pack. According to customers, Salamander "addressed a lot of pain points that
other platforms couldn't", is "a god-tier setup", also _**"the web interface is
super intuitive and it is really easy to get started"**_. Over half of customer
support emails include a note of appreciation.

I sold Salamander to fastai. It became a vital resource for their community of
100k students. I built Salamander using AWS, Node, React & GraphQL.

I inherited a codebase abandoned partway through a rewrite from Node to Ruby,
_**reduced the scope of engineering projects**_, and identified which planned
features were essential. Each leader at VenueScanner had a unique perspective,
which I helped guide toward an _**affirmative product direction**_. I created a
messaging platform with integrated contract negotiation & payments.

In addition to brownfield development, I also:

- Identified and fixed critical security issues
- Responded to service outtages; and improved uptime, from 90% to 99%
- Reduced loading time for customer support tickets, from 2 minutes to 5 seconds

</div>

Beyond Labs nutured my (then) nascent technical leadership skills. I migrated
years of prior work to React. I helped the team _**adopt practices like
continous integration**_ and automated testing. I built common libraries to help
scale the product team from one to four developers and _**redesigned parts of
the codebase**_. I also _**wrote feature proposals and planned sprints**_.

Some completed projects at Beyond include:

- Internationalisation tooling, with spreadsheet integration
- Rules engine for matching accounting records with projects
- Datagrid library which can load and scroll through _**100k+ rows without any
  perceptible delay**_

Given sole responsibility for isolated parts of MyGravity. I chose React &
Redux, to build the reporting dashboard and campaign management tools.

Transformed completed designs into a minimum viable product under supervision.
Created the first interactive prototypes for most features available on the
website today.

## Education

- Taught myself programming with online resources in 2013
- Taught myself Machine Learning (including Deep Learning) in 2017
- Reading 35 books every year

## Favourite Things

This section was originally called "Skills", but there's more to engineering
than "React and 7 other frontend frameworks" (Ember, Angular 1, Angular 2,
jQuery, Backbone, Elm, Cycle). Engineers like me can explain their work to
anyone, help teams ask good questions, and navigate an array of useful mental
models. I can explain how computers work from transitor chemistry upto the v8
internals. I can narrate 150 years of computer history in detail and recognise
when trends repeat themselves. I can pick context-specific algorithms and data
structures.

- web framework: React; approachable team, and always raising the bar for UI
  excelence
- deep learning framework: PyTorch; versatile, and enables easy experimentation
- language: JavaScript; it is ugly and beautiful, adapts to new ideas, and helps
  you build things fast
- runtime: Node; it's JavaScript, but would be nice to build with something new
  (like Go or Rust)
- datastore: Prisma; a productivity revolution that just works and can adapt
- SOLID principle: dependency inversion; did this for years, but only learned
  the name recently
- software pattern: bowtie; distinguish between core functionality and business
  logic
- VCS: git; remember `git merge -Xignore-all-space` when introducing an
  autoformatter
- fiction: The Poetry Cloud; Liu supports philosophical exposition with
  technical detail
- non-ficition: Making Learning Whole; how to share skills/knowledge effectively
- philosophy: ascendency; predict the future, and explain the present
- absurdity: I cannot decide between Dadaism and evaluating variables at extreme
  values
- sport: dance; it makes others happy to see me dancing, and I like spreading
  joy
- podcast: The Knowledge Project; Shane demonstrates how to listen actively and
  ask good questions
- cellular automata: Brian's Brain; the emergent structures are interesting
