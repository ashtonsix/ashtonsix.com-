the cloudscraper elephants arrived first. the clouds started to disappear, and
after 500 years they were gone. it was always sunny. the skyscraper elephants
arrived second. the sky became black; the stars became beautiful

the spacescraper elephants arrived last. the emptiness between stars started to
dissapear. Alpha Centurai looks like the moon. the observable universe became
busier. far away at the edge, new stars appeared. the universe was big once. now
the aliens, God, her queendom and the angels fit inside a box. when all the
emptiness was gone, so was time and everything. there is a new emptiness for
whoever comes next
